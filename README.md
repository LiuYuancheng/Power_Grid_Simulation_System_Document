### Project Design Purpose and Background

The primary objective of this project is to develop a Power Grid Operational Technology (OT) digital twin/equivalent system that can be used for cyber-security related activities.

In the real world, an **electrical grid** (or **electricity network**) is an interconnected system for delivering electricity from producers to consumers. These grids consist of power stations for energy generation, electrical substations for stepping voltage up or down, high-voltage transmission systems for carrying power over long distances, and distribution systems that deliver electricity to end users. The key components of an electrical grid are divided into three main parts: **generation and storage**, **transmission**, and **distribution**.

This project aims to create a software-based digital twin that simulates both the energy delivery process among grid components and the operational flow between physical components, OT controllers, and SCADA software. An overview of the system is shown in the image below:

![](img/rm/rm_02.png)

We Follow the [International Electrotechnical Commission](https://iec.ch/) IEC 61850, IEC 60617 standard when design and built the system, the system is a POC project and the real world energy system is more complex. This cyber range platform serves multiple purposes including cyber exercises, ICS professional training, OT security project R&D, testing and demonstration (Such as conducting cyber security exercises to demonstrate and assess the impact of various IT attacks on OT systems).

### Project Introduction

The **Mini OT-Energy-System Cyber Security Test Platform** is a comprehensive software platform designed to simulate the essential operations of a small-scale hybrid power grid. The key objectives of this project will cover:

- **Cybersecurity Training & Exercises**: The platform will enable hands-on cybersecurity exercises, allowing professionals to explore and mitigate the effects of various cyber-attacks on OT systems.
- **OT System Simulation**: Simulating power grid operations with components that follow the [International Electrotechnical Commission](https://iec.ch/) standards, particularly IEC 61850 (communication networks and systems for power utility automation) and IEC 60617 (graphical symbols for diagrams), ensuring adherence to industry protocols.
- **Research & Development (R&D)**: Providing a research platform to explore and develop novel cybersecurity strategies, protocols, and solutions specifically for OT systems in the energy sector.
- **Training for ICS Professionals**: Offering a realistic environment for industrial control system (ICS) professionals to enhance their understanding of OT operations and cyber-attack scenarios in a controlled, risk-free setting.
- **R&D and Testing**: Facilitating the testing of new OT security tools and protocols, as well as demonstrating the impact of cyber-attacks on critical infrastructures, such as power generation and distribution networks.

This digital twin provides a dynamic environment for simulating power generation from multiple sources, including natural gas power plants, solar farms, and wind turbine farms. It also simulates high-voltage power transmission and a three-level step-down distribution system. The system overview is shown below:

![](img/rm/rm_03.png)

At the core of the system is a SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system, which integrates key components such as Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), Remote Terminal Units (RTUs), and Metering Units (MUs). These components work together to enable real-time data monitoring, control, and communication, while an intuitive Human-Machine Interface (HMI) allows operators to oversee and manage grid activities. The platform follows the IEC 61850 standard for power system communications, ensuring compatibility with modern power grid structures.

The system architecture consists of three primary modules:

- **2D Visualization Program**: Simulates the physical-world devices and components of the power grid, providing a clear visual representation of grid operations.
- **OT Field Controller Simulation**: Includes simulation programs for PLCs, sensors, Metering Units (MUs), and Remote Control Units (RTUs) that enable interaction between the gridâ€™s physical elements and the control systems.
- **SCADA-HMI System**: Provides supervisory control and real-time monitoring of the simulated power grid, allowing for detailed oversight of grid performance and operations.

Beyond replicating traditional grid functionalities, the simulation also incorporates smart grid features. This includes automated detection of unusual situations, alerts, and adaptive generation-load balancing to emulate how modern power grids respond to disruptions and maintain system equilibrium.

### System Structure

The simulation provides a modular, comprehensive approach to replicating real-world power generation, transmission, and distribution processes. It will integrate physical-world simulation with various control and monitoring units, including electrical metering units (MUs), programmable logic controllers (PLCs), remote terminal units (RTUs), and a SCADA-HMI interface. By offering full-spectrum emulation from Level 0 (physical field devices and sensors) to Level 2 (control center operations) as shown below, this platform creates a robust environment to simulate operational activities and vulnerabilities.

![](img/rm/rm_04.png)

The platform consists of three primary components, each targeting a different level of OT system requirements:

- `OT Level 0`: A 2D simulation program representing the physical-world processes of a power grid, including energy generation from natural gas, solar, and wind sources, as well as the physical flow of electricity through transmission lines and distribution networks.
- `OT Level 1`: Simulation of power system controllers, including MU, PLC, and RTU functionalities, responsible for gathering, processing, and transmitting data from field devices to supervisory systems.
- `OT Level 2`: A fully integrated SCADA-HMI system that provides real-time visualization, monitoring, and control of the simulated power grid, ensuring seamless interaction with the OT environment.
