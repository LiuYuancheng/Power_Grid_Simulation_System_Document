### Power System Controller Simulation (MU, PLC & RTU) Introduction

The **OT Field Controller System** plays a pivotal role in managing data and control flows between the 2D Power Grid Physical-world Simulation and the SCADA system. It automates the operation of electrical devices, gathers real-time data from the grid simulation, and relays critical information to the Human-Machine Interface (HMI) in the SCADA system. Additionally, it receives control commands from the HMI, adjusting the state of relevant components in the physical-world simulation accordingly. 

The system work flow diagram is shown below:

Key features of the controller system include:

- **PLCs and Circuit Breaker Control**: Three PLCs are connected to 23 remote-controlled circuit breakers within the Physical-world Simulator. They communicate with the HMI using the Modbus-TCP protocol (IEC 61850), allowing operators to manage grid operations in real-time.
- **Measurement Units (MU) and Sensor Data Collection**: Eight MUs are connected to 29 Sampled Value (SV) sensors that collect data from the grid. This data is processed and transmitted to a Remote Terminal Unit (RTU), following the IEC 61850 workflow (current version we use PLC to simulate the SV-IED-MMS-RTU flow).
- **RTU Data Feedback**: The RTU consolidates data from the eight MUs and sends processed information back to the HMI for monitoring and control purposes.

This simulation replicates real-world power system operations, ensuring seamless integration between control devices and grid components while allowing users to monitor and manipulate the system through an intuitive SCADA-HMI interface.
